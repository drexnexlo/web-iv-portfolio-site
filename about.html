                    <p>Hi, my name is Drew Nelson. I'm a graphic designer
                    living and loving in Lincoln, Nebraska. I'm originally from
                    the great Pacific Northwest and have lived all over the
                    country and experienced many great things and met lots of
                    lovely people. I have walked in many shoes: (baker, chef,
                    record store guy, barista, history student, vegetable
                    farmer, interpretive hike leader, after-school programmer,
                    cheese-maker, fermenter, and traveller.) To be quite
                    honest, I loved every one of these experiences, and believe
                    that they help me in my practice and love of graphic
                    design! My goal is to create unique and positive design
                    that will help make changes in the world and bring people
                    together.</p>
                    <p>If you like what you see on this website, let me know! I
                    can't wait to meet more people who dig design and want to
                    share ideas or work together!</p>
